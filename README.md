# Queue in C++

A Queue is a linear data structure that works on the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
This means the element that is inserted first will be the one to get removed first — similar to people standing in a line.

# Key Operations

Enqueue → Insert an element at the back of the queue.

Dequeue → Remove an element from the front of the queue.

Front → Access the element at the front (the next to be removed).

Back → Access the element at the back (the most recently added).

Empty → Check if the queue has no elements.

Size → Get the total number of elements in the queue.

# Characteristics

Elements are always inserted from the back and removed from the front.

Maintains order of processing (first come, first served).

Implemented in C++ using the Standard Template Library (STL) under the <queue> header.

# Applications of Queue

Task Scheduling → Example: managing processes in an operating system.

Breadth-First Search (BFS) → Used in graph and tree traversals.

Buffering → Useful in data transfer and streaming.

Resource Management → Example: printer queues, customer service systems.

# To Conclude:
A Queue is ideal when you need to process elements in the exact order they arrive.
